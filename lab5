I'm having issues with the filter method of ListExamples. I am getting an index out of bound error which I think could indicate that my result list size is wrong. I think my conditional is correctly checking if the list item is the indicated string so I'm not sure how to go about solving this issue.

TA reply:
To double check that your code is correctly filtering the input list, try adding a print line at every iteration to see what is being added to your result list. This might clue as to what the error could be: either you are not filtering the input list correctly or there is a problem with adding them to the result list.
